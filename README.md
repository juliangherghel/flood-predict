# flood-predict
Predict UK areas at high risk of flooding
## Problem Statement
Several areas in the UK are liable to flooding due to the country's geography and increasing severity of weather patterns such as hurricanes and week-long storms.

Many people such as myself will park their cars in free, unrestricted, but also unmonitored areas in somewhat close proximity to airports or other locations of interest in order to avoid paying the expensive parking fees, especially when wanting to leave the car parked for more than a few hours. Aside from theft and vandalism, a significant risk of doing this is returning to find your car damaged by flooding.

This intelligent application leverages the UK's Environment Agency Real Time flood-monitoring API to collect and store data covering:
- flood warnings and flood alerts
- flood areas to which warnings or alerts apply
- measurements of water levels and flows
- information on the monitoring stations providing those measurements

## Acknowlegements

This uses Environment Agency flood and river level data from the real-time data API (Beta)
